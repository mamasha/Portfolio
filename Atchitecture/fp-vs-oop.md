Functional programming vs object oriented programming

- Data and behaviour should not be linked together
- Program as a flow of data
- Data is always a POCO, DTO - just properties without any method
- Behaviour has always an interface
- Most members of a behaviour are read only
- No state in behaviour
- No side effects
- No singletons - all parameters are explicit

- The main tool of OOP is inheretance and virtual methods
-
