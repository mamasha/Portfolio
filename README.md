# Ruven Bass's portfolio

Hello there. I am aiming to be a software architect. Architects build things.
Here is my journy - my projects that took hours of thinking, designing and implementing.

##### Architecture
- **[Programming to an interface](Architecture/programming-to-an-interface.md)**
- **[Separation of concerns through decorator and sequence of operations](separation-of-concerns.md)**
- **[Five principals of any design](five-principals.md)**
- **[Functional programming vs object oriented programming](fp-vs-oop.md)**
- **[Service oriented programming](soa-programming.md)**
- Volatility based decomposition
- **[Fighting complexity](fighting-complexity.md)**
- Error handling how, when and why
- Threading and synchronization models
