# Reuven Bass's portfolio

Hello there. I am aiming to be a software architect. Architects build things.
Here is my journey - my projects that took hours of thinking, designing and implementing.

##### Architecture

- **[Separation of concerns through decorator and sequence of operations](Architecture/separation-of-concerns.md)**
- **[Five principals of any design](Architecture/five-principles.md)**
- **[Functional programming vs object oriented programming](Architecture/fp-vs-oop.md)**
- **[Service oriented programming](Architecture/soa-programming.md)**
- Volatility based decomposition
- **[Fighting complexity](Architecture/fighting-complexity.md)**
- Error handling how, when and why
- Monitoring and troubleshooting highly concurrent heavy loaded message oriented infrastructure
- Threading and synchronization models
